# üè¶ Devsu Banking Platform - Java Microservices

This repository combines two independent Spring Boot services that collaborate to deliver the Devsu digital banking experience. Each service owns its persistence layer, exposes a REST API, and can evolve on its own release cadence.

- **ms-java-client** ‚Äì customer and person management capabilities.
- **ms-java-account** ‚Äì account lifecycle, transaction processing, and reporting features.

Both services adopt consistent engineering conventions so teams can move between codebases without friction.

## Technology Highlights

- Java 21 runtime
- Spring Boot 3.3.x with Spring Data JPA
- Maven build system
- MySQL 8 as the relational datastore
- Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- Spring Security with JWT authentication (account service)
- Spring Boot Actuator for operational insight

---

## Architectural Consistency

Both services follow a hexagonal layout that separates the domain from delivery and infrastructure layers:

- **Domain**
  - `model`: Core business entities and value objects.
  - `port.in`: Use cases exposed to the application layer.
  - `port.out`: Contracts that infrastructure adapters must implement.
- **Application**
  - `dto`: Request/response structures used by controllers.
  - `mapper`: Translators between persistence and domain types.
  - `service`: Business workflows orchestrating the domain logic.
- **Infrastructure**
  - `controller`: REST endpoints using Spring MVC.
  - `persistence`: JPA repositories and database adapters.
  - `configuration` & `handler`: Cross-cutting setup and exception handling.

This structure keeps business rules independent from frameworks while still enabling rapid delivery.

## Configuration Notes

Each service maintains its own `application.yml` with datasource credentials, port configuration, and security policies. Update these files to match your environment before launching the applications.
